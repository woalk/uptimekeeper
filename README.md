# uptimekeeper

A simple script to keep an automatic record of computer uptimes.

## Installation

Put the script `uptimekeeper.sh` into your autostart
with any parameters set as you want.

The script will keep running unintrusively in the background.
Once it receives a signal to quit (such as `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`),
it will append the current system uptime to a specified file.

When shutting down your system,
the init system should leave this script enough time to write its uptime.
Therefore, you should not need to do anything else to make it work completely automatically.

A new uptime file is created every month.
